This is a required page and should include any templates you have created for reporting within NOAA or to other agencies.

Examples include [NEFSC PAM data reporting templates](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/resource/document/passive-acoustic-reporting-system-templates) and standard report formats for a few different agencies/species (right whales, Australian Marine Parks).
