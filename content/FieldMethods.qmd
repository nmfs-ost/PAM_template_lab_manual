title: Field Methods
---

A field methods section is highly recommended to help your team keep track of all current and past fieldwork documentation. This can be a link to a separate repository that includes more detailed methods. Things to include here can include hardware specifications, checklists for fieldwork prep, deployment and recovery methods, etc.
