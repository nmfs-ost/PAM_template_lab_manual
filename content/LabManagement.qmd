title: Lab Management
---

A lab management section is required and should include the following information;

-   Safety
    -   Both lab safety and field safety

    -   Link to your centers safety website

    -   Chemical inventory (if applicable)

    -   Lithium battery safety

        -   This is an essential section to include if your lab uses these. Work with your lab safety manager to develop handling and storage instructions. See [SAEL lab manual lithium battery page](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Safety_Lithium-Batteries.html)

    -   [SAEL Lab Example](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/Safety-Lab.html)
-   Inventory
    -   Highly recommended to keep track of equipment, loans, and gear in the field
    -   This can be a link to a Google sheet or embedded in the website
