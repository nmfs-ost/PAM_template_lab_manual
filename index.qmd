## Template Intro

This is a template for a simple Quarto website that looks like a "book". This is a common format for documentation. It includes a GitHub Action that will build the website automatically when you make changes to the files. The NOAA palette and fonts has been added to `theme.scss`. The webpage will be on the `gh-pages` branch. Serving the website files from this branch is a common way to keep all the website files from cluttering your main branch.

The GitHub Action installs R so you can have R code in your qmd or Rmd files. Note, you do not need to make changes to your Rmd files unless your need Quarto features like cross-references.

## PAM SI Lab Manual Template

### Required Pages

In order to keep consistency between science centers, the following sections/pages will be required in all lab manuals. These will be directly linked to the National PAM Repository. The links will direct you to the associated template page with more directions on what to include.

-   Home Page (this page): Edit this page to include an introduction to your lab, projects you are working on, etc.
-   [Lab Management](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/LabManagement.html)
-   [Data Management](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/DataManagement.html)
-   [Hardware](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/Hardware.html)
-   [Software](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/Software.html)
-   [Analysis](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/AnalysisMethods.html)
-   Reporting

### Optional Pages

Here are some more ideas for pages to include in your lab manual. These are optional and will not be linked to the main National PAM Repo, but they may be helpful for your team

-   [Shared values/lab culture](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/SharedValues.html)
-   [Onboarding](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/Onboarding.html)
-   [Offboarding](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/Offboarding.html)
-   [Field Methods](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/FieldMethods.html)
-   Open Science
-   Publications/Presentations
-   [Resources](https://nmfs-ost.github.io/PAM_template_lab_manual/content/Resources.html)

### Examples

Here are two lab manuals to pull inspiration from

-   [SWFSC Southwest Acoustic Ecology Lab Manual](https://sael-swfsc.github.io/SAEL-lab-manual/content/media.html)

-   [Faylab Manual](https://thefaylab.github.io/lab-manual/)
